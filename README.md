# html-validate-vitest-demo

Demo of using html-validate with vitest

Run `npm run typecheck` to reproduce https://gitlab.com/html-validate/html-validate/-/issues/311

And edit the html-validate vitest types augmentation file in node_modules to see that adding vitest import fixes the typecheck issue.
